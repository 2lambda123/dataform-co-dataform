# What is dataform?

Dataform is a framework for managing datasets and pipelines within your data warehouse.

It also provides a framework to make it easy to develop queries and dependencies, provides templating so you can re-use code across different queries, and provides pre built packages that you can use within your project so you don't have to re-invent the wheel.

There are 3 main types of things you can do in dataform:

[Materialize data sets](/guides/materializations) - create a table, or view in your warehouse from a SQL query.

[Execute arbitrary queries](/guides/operations) - run arbitrary SQL queries against your warehouse.

[Run assertions against your data](/guides/assertions) - check that data conforms to certain rules.

# What can it do?

- Publish datasets
- Write tests against your data
- Execute arbitrary SQL operations

# How can I use it?

# How does it work?

## Directed graph

Dataform compiles your project and computes a directed, acyclic graph of all the queries that should be run, and makes sure to run them in the correct order.

## API

Dataform provides APIs to make it easy to perform common tasks, such as [creating a table](/guides/materializations), or incrementally inserting new rows into a table.


## JS API

Dataform provides a way to define anything in dataform via JavaScript, check out the [JS API reference](/reference/js-api) for more info.
