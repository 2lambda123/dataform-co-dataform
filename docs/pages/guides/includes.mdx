## Introduction


Javascript files can be added in the `includes/` folder to define simple scripts, constants or macros that can promote reuse of code across your project.

Each file in the includes folder will be made available to be used within your other SQL or JavaScript files.

If you are new to Javascript, the examples below should cover most use cases. [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript) is a great resource to learn more.  

## Create an include

Create a new file in your project under the `includes/` folder, such as `definitions/example_include.js`:

```js
const PROJECT_ID = "my_project_name";
module.exports = { PROJECT_ID };
```

## Use an include in a SQL file
You can reference any include function, constant or macro by using its name preceded by the name of the include file it is in.

`definitions/query.sql`:
```sql
SELECT * FROM ${constants.PROJECT_ID}.my_schema_name.my_table_name
```


The query will be compiled into the following SQL before it is run:
```sql
SELECT * FROM my_project_name.my_schema_name.my_table_name
```


## Create an include with parameters

Writing functions can be helpful to reuse the same block of SQL logic across many different scripts. Functions can take 0 or more named parameters and need to return a string.

In the example below, we write a function `country_group` that takes as input a country_code and returns a CASE statement.


`includes/country_mapping.js`:
```js
function country_group(country){
  return `CASE
          WHEN ${country} IN ("US", "CA") THEN "NA"
          WHEN ${country} IN ("GB", "FR", "DE", "IT", "PL") THEN "EU"
          WHEN ${country} IN ("AU") THEN ${country}
          ELSE "Other countries"
          END`
}

module.exports = { country_group };
```

### Use an include with parameters
You can reference any function, constant or macro by using its name preceded by the name of the include file it is in.

`definitions/revenue_by_country_group.sql`:
```js
SELECT ${mapping.country_group("country_code")} as country_group,
       sum(revenue) as revenue

FROM my_schema.revenue_by_country

GROUP BY 1

```

The query will be compiled into the following SQL before it is run:
```sql
SELECT CASE
          WHEN country_code IN ("US", "CA") THEN "NA"
          WHEN country_code IN ("GB", "FR", "DE", "IT", "PL") THEN "EU"
          WHEN country_code IN ("AU") THEN country_code
          ELSE "Other countries"
          END as country_group,
       sum(revenue) as revenue

FROM my_schema.revenue_by_country

GROUP BY 1
```

## Other example of an include with parameters: GROUP BY

In the example below, we write a function `group_by` that takes as input a number and generates a GROUP BY statement


`includes/utils.js`:
```js
function group_by(number){
  var string = "GROUP BY ";
  for(var i=1;i<=number;i++){
    string = string + i;
    if(i<number){
      string = string + ", ";
    }
  }
  return string;
}

module.exports = { group_by };
```

### Use an include with parameters
You can reference any function, constant or macro by using its name preceded by the name of the include file it is in.

`definitions/example.sql`:
```sql
SELECT field1,
       field2,
       field3,
       field4,
       field5,
       sum(revenue) as revenue

FROM my_schema.my_table

${group_by(5)}

```

The query will be compiled into the following SQL before it is run:
```sql
SELECT field1,
       field2,
       field3,
       field4,
       field5,
       sum(revenue) as revenue

FROM my_schema.my_table

GROUP BY 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
```


## Generating entire queries

Functions can be used to generate entire queries. That can be useful if you need to create datasets with very similar structure.

The example below includes a function that aggregates all metrics with a sum and group by every dimension.


`includes/script_builder.js`:
```js
function render_script(table, dimensions, metrics) {
    return `
      SELECT
      ${dimensions.map(field => `${field} as ${field}`).join(",\n")},
      ${metrics.map(field => `sum(${field}) as ${field}`).join(",\n")}
      FROM ${table}
      GROUP BY 1, ${dimensions.map((field, i) => `${i+2}`).join(", ")}
`
}
module.exports = { render_script };
}
```

### How to use

To use the function, call it inside a SQL files


`definitions/stats_per_country_and_device.sql`:
```js
${script_builder.render_script(ref("source_table"),
                               ["country", "device_type"],
                               ["revenue", "pageviews", "sessions"]
                               )}

```

The query will be compiled into the following SQL before it is run:
```sql
SELECT country as country,
       device_type as device_type,
       sum(revenue) as revenue,
       sum(pageviews) as pageviews,
       sum(sessions) as sessions

FROM my_schema.source_table

GROUP BY 1,2
```
